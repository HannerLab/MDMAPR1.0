# MDMAPR

Welcome to MDMAPR! 

The Molecular Detection Mapping and Analysis Platform for R (MDMAPR) is an open-source bioinformatics tool for researchers to merge raw qPCR fluorescence data with associated metadata into a standard format and geospatially visualizing the distribution of the data and relative intensity of the qPCR results. 

MDMAPR aims to centralize varied qPCR data, which includes data from pathogen and environmental qPCR species detection studies, gene expression studies and quantification studies used in identifying pathogen-associated health threats. 

The novel centralized management and geospatial visualization of qPCR data in this application are designed to facilitate further cross-discipline large-scale qPCR data standardization and accessibility to support research spanning multiple fields of science and qPCR applications.
